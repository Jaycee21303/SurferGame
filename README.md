# Surfer Slider

An HTML5 canvas surfing racer inspired by classic slope gliders. Dive down the face of a wave to pick up speed, release to launch off the next swell, and see how far you can ride.

## Play on GitHub Pages
Once GitHub Pages is enabled for the repository root, the game will be available at:

```
https://jaycee21303.github.io/SurferGame/
```

You can click that link directly: <https://jaycee21303.github.io/SurferGame/>. Open that link on desktop or mobile and use the spacebar to carve the ocean.

## Controls
- **Hold space** to dive down the face of a wave and build speed.
- **Release space** at the top of a wave to launch into the air.
- **R**: restart the run.

## Local development
1. Clone the repo.
2. Serve the root directory with any static server (for example `python -m http.server 8000`).
3. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

No build steps or dependencies are required; everything is plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
